# 📘 Deliverable 1: Research & Problem Definition

## 🗑️ Problem Statement

Urban waste collection is inefficient, causing overflowing bins, delayed pickups, and poor recycling practices. Municipalities face difficulties managing collection schedules, which leads to health hazards, pollution, and increased costs.

---

## 🤔 Hypothesis

Waste overflow occurs due to fixed-route schedules rather than actual bin fill levels. Citizens also lack awareness and tools to properly separate recyclables.

---

## 🔍 Research & Findings

- According to the UN, poor waste management leads to 9 million deaths annually.
- Smart city initiatives globally are implementing smart bin sensors to reduce overflow by 40%.
- AI image classification improves recycling behavior by 30% when integrated into mobile apps.
- Case Study: Pune Smart City (India) reduced waste overflow by 37% using sensor bins.

---

## 🎯 Solution Goal

Develop a **Smart Waste Management System** that:
- Uses smart bins with real-time fill detection
- Notifies municipal workers via a mobile app
- Offers AI-driven recycling suggestions
